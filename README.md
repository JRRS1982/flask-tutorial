# flask-tutorial

## Technologies used

* Python 3.7
* Flask
* Pytest
* Coverage
* Heroku
* Wheel - library for python distribution (.whl extention)

## Setup

The flask script is nice to start a local development server, but you would have to restart it manually after each change to your code. That is not very nice and Flask can do better. If you enable debug support the server will reload itself on code changes, and it will also provide you with a helpful debugger if things go wrong.

To enable all development features (including debug mode) you can export the FLASK_ENV environment variable and set it to development before running the server:

1. Activate the virtual environment

```
$ . venv/bin/activate
```

2. Tell Flask where to find your application

```
$ export FLASK_APP=flaskr
```

3. Then set environment as development

```
$ export FLASK_ENV=development
```

4. Run the program via the terminal by entering;

```
flask run
```

Which should launch a simple local server at http://127.0.0.1:5000/

To create a flaskr.sqlite file if missing from the ./instance file, run the
following command to initialize the database.

```
$ flask init-db
```

### Notes

### Install the project in the virtual environment

Use pip to install the project in the virtual environment.

This command tells pip to find setup.py in the current directory and install it in editable or development mode. You can "$ pip list" to check that the project is now installed. 
```
$ pip install -e
```

#### Setup.py: 
The setup.py file describes the project and the files that belong to it.

Packages tells Python what package directories (and the Python files they contain) to include. find_packages() finds these directories automatically so you donâ€™t have to type them out. To include other files, such as the static and templates directories, include_package_data is set. Python needs another file named MANIFEST.in to tell what this other data is.

Python also requires another file called MANIFEST.in to tell it what other data is. 

This tells Python to copy everything in the static and templates directories, and the schema.sql file, but to exclude all bytecode files.

Further information about packaging of projects can be found here:

## Testing

Pytest was used for testing the project, although a TDD approach was not followed, as this is a new language for me, in a new framework and i was following a tutorial which wasn't following the process.

Each test will create a new temporary database file and populate some data that will be used
in the tests. The tutorial suggested a SQL file that was used to insert that data.

The app fixture will call the factory and pass test_config to configure the application and database for testing instead of using your local development configuration.

To install the project (don't forget the dot!) which allows you to run tests:
```
$ pip install -e .
```

To run the tests, with pytest use the following command from the root (./flask-tutorial).
```
$ pytest
```
To measure the code coverage of the tests, use the coverage command:
```
$ coverage run -m pytest
```
Then open htmlcov/index.html in the browser which will produce a coverage report, while in the browser you can navigate around by clicking on files and find those lines that currently lack coverage.

An more details HTML report allows you to see which lines were covered in each file... if you really want that:
```
$ coverage html
```
